Install ROS2 if you don't have it. Developed on Humble and tested to work on Foxy, as far as I know. Robolab Franka and CV PCs have Foxy installed.

python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv

If you don't use --system-site-packages, you have to install more packages manually to make
ROS2 able to build the ws, and/or work at all. I don't remember all this by heart, but maybe
I'll figure it out again later.

The downside of doing this way is that non-ros packages will be included as well, and this may cause conflicts when installing from pip.
On the CV PC, I had to manually install the newest absl-py and protobuf=3.20.2. You can read any warnings shown by pip to see potential issues,
but note that stated conflicts aren't always a problem in practice. For instance, tensorflow is incorrectly listed as conflicting with 
protobuf 3.20.2 due to some incorrect definitions.

------

ROS2 is badly designed for VENV situations, so you need to add

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:"$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3.8/site-packages"

to venv/bin/activate, or do something equivalent elsewhere.

We also recommend an alias for easier building:

alias lmpvc_build='colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DPython3_EXECUTABLE="$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python"'

With this in your /bin/activate, you can simply use the command 'lmpvc_build' anytime after sourcing the venv to
always call colcon build with the right arguments.

------

You can now build!

Before first build:

source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash

To build:

lmpvc_build

Expect a ton of random warnings, that's just colcon for you.
------

Recommended for big packages like torch and transformers:

pip install --no-cache-dir *package*

especially in robolab where space is limited. Finally, to avoid downloading models
to home directory for the same reason:

TORCH_HOME="$VIRTUAL_ENV/torch"
export TORCH_HOME

HF_HOME="/media/opendr/My Passport/computer_vision_pc/user_files/ossi/llm/hf_cache/"
export HF_HOME

The above are just examples from the scripts I use. These can be added to /venv/bin/activate, or a dedicated startup script you run every
time you source the venv.

-----

Package requirements (roughly):
ROS2 python requirements:
	- these should already exist if running on robolab franka and cv PCs and used --system-site-packages
pytroch:
	- visit pytorch.org to get the correct command to install for your hardware
	- cv PC: pip install --no-cache-dir torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
transformers:
	- install pytorch first to avoid getting the wrong version here
	- starcoder2 recommends installing from source (like below)
	- pip install --no-cache-dir git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
accelerate:
	- pip install --no-cache-dir accelerate
bitsandbytes
	- pip install --no-cache-dir bitsandbytes
astunparse:
	- pip install astunparse
pyaudio:
	- pip install pyaudio
pyttsx3:
	- sudo apt install espeak ffmpeg, if necessary
	- pip install pyttsx3

You can also try to use the included requirements.txt with pip install -r requirements.txt, but this probably won't work if your system
configuration is different from mine. It may be a useful reference as well.
